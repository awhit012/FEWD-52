# FEWD Week #3: CSS Lab & Bootstrap

---

### Description


For the third assignment, you will continue working on Bootstrap boilerplate. Today in class you made the columns responsive with a breakpoint! Over the weekend you are going to make this your own.

  *suggestion: White text on color photo background. If photo is to light, make the background black, and give it a .8 opacity*

Steps:
1. Study the HTML. What is making the Learn More button blue? What is making the Sign In button Green?
1. What else can you learn from this boilerplate code?
1. Come up with a real site idea and:
  - Name the project
  - Replace the headings with relevant 'real' headings,
  - Add an appropriate background img to the jumbotron

1. Finally create a second page that links to this one. Use the [docs](http://getbootstrap.com/) This page should:
  - Use Bootstrap's grid system
  - Use at least one [Glyphicon](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
  - Use the [thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails) class somewhere on the page.

### Real-World Applications


- Use boilerplate Bootstrap to quickly start a modern looking project
- Take advantage of Bootstrap's built in styling

---

### Technical Requirements
- Make the boilerplate jumbotron page your own with style, an image and using real text for headlines
- Create a second page that links to the first page
- Use Bootstrap's grid system to make the second page responsive
- Use two breakpoints so your site looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop (shrink your browser to test)
- Use the thumbnail component somewhere on the page
- Continue to use HTML & CSS best practices including:
  - Proper indentation
  - alt tags on imgs
  - relevant metadata (lang, doctype, charset)


#### Bonus

- Look into bootstraps other features and implement them as you please.
- Include the JS files and jQuery in your index.html and get the dropdown menu to work!
