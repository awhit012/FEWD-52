# AJAX and External APIS

## Objectives
- Review project set up with bootstrap and jQuery
- Demo AJAX
- Make an AJAX request to GET data from the OMDB API
- Display that data on the page

### Review

- In class Demo of setting up a project
- This will get pushed into a starter code folder for you to pull down and use

### Demo AJAX
- Live code pulling data from the Giphy API and displaying it on the page

### OMDB - Your Turn
#### Take it step by step:
1. Figure out the URL you need to get the correct data
2. Test it by putting it directly in the browser bar
3. Write your AJAX code
4. console.log the response to see what you get
5. Grab the part of the data you want. Is it response.data? response.data[0]? It depends on what you want to grab, and how the data is structured.
6. Use jQuery to append the data to the DOM
7. Celebrate!
