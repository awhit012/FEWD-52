# TODO lab

## Today we are going to create a real, working web application!
This lab will combine:
1. jQuery DOM selection
2. jQuery appending to DOM
3. HTML forms
4. Events
5. Bootstrap

## Objectives
- Write jQuery and JavaScript to create a Todo List application. It should...
  - Take input from a form
  - Append items to a list
  - Each item should have a delete button to remove it from the list
