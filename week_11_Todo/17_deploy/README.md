# Deploying Online

## Deploying front end projects is easy! 
### Thanks to free services like BitBaloon and Github Pages. 

1. BitBalloon
- Features drag and drop. 
- All you need is a front end project with the main fail in the root folder
- and that file to be called `index.html`
- and drag and drop that folder onto the bitbaloon site

[Site Here](https://www.bitballoon.com/)

2. GitHub Pages
- Also quite easy, though not drag and drop. Very convenient if already using GitHub.
- Just create an account
- Create a 'repo' called your-user-name.github.io
- upload your project to that repo
